# Spring Boot Auth with JWT

Hereâ€™s a simple way to protect your REST API using JWT and Spring Security. This is the same method I used in my Task Manager API.

### Key Features:

- **Spring Security**: A powerful tool for securing your application.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens to handle authentication.
- **Spring Boot**: For the back-end framework.

### Steps to Implement JWT in Spring Boot:

1. **Add Dependencies**: Add Spring Security and JWT dependencies to your `pom.xml`.
2. **Configure Security**: Use `HttpSecurity` to configure the security settings and enable JWT authentication.
3. **Create JWT Utility Class**: A class for generating and validating JWT tokens.
4. **Create Authentication Filter**: A filter to intercept requests and validate JWT tokens.
5. **Protect Endpoints**: Secure your REST API endpoints by requiring valid tokens.

### Conclusion:

With these simple steps, you can easily add JWT-based authentication to your Spring Boot application and secure your API.
