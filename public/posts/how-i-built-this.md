# How I Built This Portfolio

This site is made with React + TypeScript, styled using TailwindCSS. Blog posts are loaded via Markdown and routing is handled by React Router.

### Technologies Used:

- **React** for the front-end framework.
- **TypeScript** for type safety.
- **TailwindCSS** for utility-first CSS styling.
- **Markdown** for writing posts.
- **React Router** for routing.

I used the following approach for the development:

1. **Structure**: I structured the application with clean components and ensured scalability.
2. **Styling**: I used TailwindCSS for quick styling and responsiveness.
3. **Routing**: Each post is dynamically routed using React Router.

Stay tuned for more details on the development process in upcoming posts!
